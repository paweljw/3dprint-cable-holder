# Cable holder

This is a very simple cable holder that you can 3D print.

## Usage

Copy `configuration.scad.example` into `configuration.scad`.

Adjust the parameters found in `configuration.scad`. I especially recommend taking a good,
hard look at your edge thickness - you should also keep in mind the tolerances of your
extruder, any cooling shrink etc.

Afterward, run `make`. You obviously need `make` and [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/).

## TODO

- [ ] Some in-action photos
- [ ] Clean up cable ring code (blocked - see below)
- [ ] Learn stereometric math, like, better
